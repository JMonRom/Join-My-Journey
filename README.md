## The Process 

The task was to update my portfolio page and add some new features and keep uploading completed projects so that I can continue to gain experience. Redoing the layout and adding different uses from bootstrap was really fun to work with because I noticed how much improvement my understanding of these tools has reached. The site should display a navbar with scrolling options to bio, projects, resume, and contact bar.
